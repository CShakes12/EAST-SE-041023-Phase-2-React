# React Context

---

## âœ… Objectives

## ðŸ”© Prop Drilling

- Occassionally you may find yourself passing props deeply down the component tree across many components 

This can get very complicated, tedious, and messy...

---

## Context

That's why we have React Context!

- React Context provides a way to share data across components without manually passing props to each component
- This is useful for passing down user preferences or authentication status, location-specific data, dark theme or light theme

## How to use context?

1. create the context 
2. wrap your components with the context provider
3. pass any values into your context provider
4. read the value in whatever component you want using the context consumer (useContext)

---

## createContext()

- To create a context we use `createContext()`!
- This method returns a Provider and Consumer component

```js
const UserContext = React.createContext(defaultValue)
```

Note: it is typical to create a separate file containing your contexts

---

## The Provider

- The provider is a React component that allows child components to use our context 
- We pass a value prop to the provider which can be anything - a string, object, function, etc.

```js
//NOTE: YOU HAVE TO USE THE TERM 'VALUE'
<UserContext.Provider value={null}>
    <App /> 
</ UserContext.Provider>
```

- When the Provider's values change, all the Provider's descendants will re-render
- All we really do with the Provider is define what the Provider is capable of and wrap the appropriate components with it.

---

## The Consumer and `useContext()` 

- We call a descendant of the Provider 'The Consumer' when it wants to consume/use the data of the Provider
- In any given component nested in the provider you can subscribe to the context:

```js
import { useContext } from 'react';
import { UserContext } from '<path>';

function someComponent() {
    const ctx = useContext(UserContext)

    return(
        <div>
            {ctx.value}
        </div>
    )
}
```

---

## Warning

- don't use context right away, see if you can better organize your components to avoid prop drilling (component composition)
```js
function SomeComponent(props) {
  return (
    <div className={'bla bla bla' + props.value}>
      {props.children} { /* some series of children we can't hardcode */ }
    </div>
  );
}
```
- context is very useful when you're dealing with users

- be careful about updating values that get passed down with context
- this is because all the components that use that value will re-render
- if we use a value in a lot of components this can cause performance issues
